Theorical Researches on Prime Numbers


How many time ?
- 5 months between January and May 2014 (but occasionally)


Context of the project:
- At school and at the end of "Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Ecoles", we had to realize a personal project. I had in my mind a method for generating Prime Numbers, so we have worked on explicite it.

	- BOUTANT Thomas
	- RAUX Gaël
